# Introduction to functional brain parcellation in fMRI

This notebook is an introduction to parcellation of the brain using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The notebook mixes figures, text and code to introduce some key concepts and results from the literature. The code is in python and is mainly based on the [nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/) library.

Some image and code snippets were taken for the following tutorials:
